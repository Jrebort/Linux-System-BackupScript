# Linux-System-BackupScript
  This is a Shell Script about Linux System.  
  I am user of ubuntu OS and I don\`t like dejagnu to backup my system.  
  Because I cannot use it to restore my system when I cannot access the graphical interface.  
  So this script came into being!  

## How to backup your OS?
  - `cd Linux-System-BackupScript`  
  - `chmod +x ./BackupSystem.sh`  
  - `su`   (Enter your root password, this need root privilege)  
  - `./BackupSystem.sh`
